# Circuit Elements
In this part of the lab, we will review the concepts and mathematical descriptions of some common circuit elements.


## 1. Resistors and Ohm‚Äôs Law
If there is a potential difference, electrons (negatively charged) will move from low potential to high potential. The movement of electrons forms current. Current is defined as the rate at which charges move:

::: Equation currentcharge
$$
I =  \frac{dQ}{dt}
$$
:::
Resistors will slow the rate at which charge flows. Current, resistance, and potential difference are related by Ohm‚Äôs Law:

::: Equation
$$
I =  \frac{\Delta V}{R}
$$
:::

where $\Delta V$ is the voltage across the resistor in Volts (V), $R$ is the resistance of the resistor in Ohms (‚Ñ¶), and $I$ is the current in the resistor in Amperes (A).


Recall that for resistors in series, the equivalent resistance is given by

::: Equation Rseries
$$
R_{eq} =  R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}
$$
:::
And for resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is given by

::: Equation Rparallel
$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}} =  \frac{1}{R_{1}}+ \frac{1}{R_{2}}+ \frac{1}{R_{3}}
$$
:::

::: Question
A 5-kŒ© resistor is placed in series with two 10-kŒ© resistors in parallel. The entire circuit is connected to a power supply of 20 V. What is the voltage across each element?
:::

## 2. Capacitors

::: RFigure antenna m
![Skematic of a simple parallel plate capacitor](../imgs/1.png)
:::

A capacitor is a device that stores energy by means of two closely spaced plates separated by an insulating material. By connecting a capacitor to a battery source, we will be able to collect charge on the capacitor. The energy is stored as an electrostatic field.



The voltage across a capacitor is directly related to the amount of charge on the plates. A larger amount of charge results in a larger potential difference across the capacitor. The relation between the voltage across and the amount of charges on the capacitor is given by

::: Equation
$$
V =  \frac{Q}{C}
$$
:::

where $Q$ is the charge in Coulombs (C), $C$ is the capacitance in Farads (F), and $V$ is the voltage in Volts (V).


Using the definition of current [Eq](#Eq-currentcharge), we have

::: Equation
$$
I =  \frac{d(CV)}{dt} = C \frac{dV}{dt}
$$
:::

which relates the current into a capacitor to the rate of change of the voltage. Note that it takes some time to build up charges. So the voltage across a capacitor cannot instantaneously increase.

::: Question
1. A 0.1-ŒºF capacitor has 16 V across its terminals. How much change does it hold?
2. What is the current flowing into a 0.01-ŒºF capacitor if the voltage across its terminals changes at a constant rate of 2 mV per second?
:::

::: Figure
![capacitor charge/discharge plot](../imgs/2.png)
:::
Before the switch is closed, the capacitor initially begins without charge and thus carries 0 voltage. At the instant the switch is closed, the charging process begins, and charges start to build up on the plates. The voltage, however, cannot change instantaneously. At this moment, because there is no charge on the plates, it is easy for charges to pass through. Therefore, the greatest amount of current flows at this first instant.

As the current flows, the capacitor becomes charged, and its voltage builds up gradually. As the capacitor‚Äôs voltage increases, the voltage on the resistor decreases.  By  Ohm&rsquo;s Law, this means that less current flows through the resistor. Recall that the same current goes through all elements in series. Thus, less current through the resistor results in slower charging of the capacitor.

The charging process continues as the voltage on the capacitor asymptotically approaches that of the power source. At this point, the current decreases to 0, and voltage on the resistor goes to 0 as shown on the figure above.





Discharging a capacitor reverses the process. Say the fully charged capacitor has voltage $V_0$. When the circuit is closed, the voltage on the capacitor will be dropped across the resistor, causing a current to flow. As the charges leave the capacitor, the voltage on the capacitor asymptotically falls to zero.

::: Question
1. Why does the greatest amount of current flow initially? Why does it decrease as time passes?
2. Why does the voltage across the resistor decrease to 0 V later in time?
3. Comment on how voltage changes across capacitor and resistor separately during the discharging process. You may use words or plots or both.
:::

Combining equations (2) and (6) and rearranging, we get 

::: Equation
$$
\int_{V_0}^{V} \frac{dV}{V}=  - \frac{1}{RC}\int_{0}^{t} dt
$$
:::

Solving this integral, we find that the equation for the capacitor discharging is described by

::: Equation
$$
V=  V_0 e^{- \frac{t}{RC}}
$$
:::
This indicates that the voltage across the capacitor decreases exponentially as current passes through. The value RC is defined as the time constant ùõï. Therefore, the quantity RC has units of time, and the equation becomes

::: Equation
$$
V(t)=  V_0 e^{- \frac{t}{\tau}}
$$
:::
It is important to note that for one circuit, $\tau$ is constant.


::: Question
Write down the equation for a charging capacitor. You can assume that the fully charged capacitor has voltage $V_0$.
:::

In this lab, we will build the described RC circuit with a switchable battery source (powerblock device). When the battery source is turned on, the capacitor will charge up according to the equation above. When the battery is turned off, the capacitor will discharge instead.

In addition to calculating the time constant for different circuits, we will be wiring the capacitors in both series and parallel configurations. The equation for the equivalent capacitance for capacitors in series is

::: Equation Cseries
$$
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} =  \frac{1}{C_1}+ \frac{1}{C_2}
$$
:::

The equation for the equivalent capacitance for capacitors in parallel is

::: Equation Cparallel
$$
C_{eq} =  C_1+C_2
$$
:::

# Experiments
In this lab we will measure the time constant, $\tau$, of four different circuit configurations. The procedure for each of these labs is fairly quick and virtually identical. After the initial identification of your circuit components and the set-up of your first circuit, you will only have to switch out elements and record new data for each exercise.

## 0. Pre-lab Set-up

Even though the resistors and capacitors are labeled in the electronic kit, it's useful to learn how the resistance is color coded. It is recommended to double check the 5-band code to make sure the resistors you are using is correct for the lab, especially if you have removed them from their packaging already.

::::::Hider Identifying Resistors
Learning to read and identify resistors is a crucial skill in real laboratory work. Resistors are the small capsule-shaped elements with wires on either side. You should notice that each resistor has a set of four colored bands around its body. The order and color of these bands indicate the element's resistance and *tolerance* -- i.e. its margin of error as a percent of the ideal value.

In a 5-band resistor, the first four bands tell you the value of $R$, and the $5^{\rm th}$ band gives you the tolerance. To read your resistor, first we need to determine the correct reading direction. There should be a larger gap between the $4^{\rm th}$ and $5^{\rm th}$ (tolerance) bands.

There are two ways you can use the colors to assign values -- either by using the lookup table below or by using an [online calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code).

:::Figure

:::

Prior to starting the experiments, you should find the resistors for this lab and double check the resistance. For students with the RexQualis kit, in total, you should have 10-20 of the following:

- @fa-chevron-right@ 10/100/220/330 Œ© Resistors
- @fa-chevron-right@ 1/2/5.1/10/100 kŒ© Resistors
- @fa-chevron-right@ 1 MŒ© Resistors


::::::

:::Hider Identifying Capacitors

The capacitors, which are black cylindrical elements with wires coming from the bottom, are much easier to identify: simply read off the values printed on the side. You should find 10 of the following:

- @fa-chevron-right@ 10/100 ŒºF Electrolytic Capacitors
- @fa-chevron-right@ 22 pF/ 100 nF Ceramic Capacitors

Electrolytic capacitors are very different from their ceramic counterparts[fn]For detailed information please see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolytic_capacitor)[/fn]. Rather than holding charge on sepearted surfaces, they store charges in electrolytes, similar to a battery. Because of this, electrolytic capacitors are **polarized**, meaning they have designated positive and negaive leads, each connecting to a different kind of electrolyte. When using electrolytic capacitors **please make use that you repect the orientation** by checking for the + and - symbols on the shell.

The capcitors suppled by the RexQualis kit are manufactured by Hyncdz. You may assume these capacitors have a 20% tolerance. If you are using a capacitor from a different manufacturer, especially if it is a different kind of capacitor, please look up the data sheet for the component.
::::::

:::Question
In the following exercises, we will need:
- 1-MŒ© resistors 
- 10 ŒºF capacitors
- 100 ŒºF capacitors 

Using the tolerance, write down the values of these components with their uncertainty in the form:
- ($1 \pm \delta_R$) MŒ©
- ($10 \pm \delta_C$) ŒºF
- ($100 \pm \delta_C$) ŒºF

Here $\delta$ should be an *absolute* uncertainty, not a percent. For example, if your tolerance was 1% on your 1-MŒ© resistor, you would record the value as  ($1 \pm 0.01$) MŒ©. For both capacitors, use the tolerance of 20% to calculate the uncertainty. We will use this later for error analysis. 
:::


Now let‚Äôs set up 4 RC circuits. For each setup, you will measure the time constant and compare it to the theoretical value.


## 1. A 10-ŒºF capacitor and a 1-MŒ© resistor in series

::: Materials
- Wire Leads and breadboard
- One 1-MŒ© resistor
- One 10-ŒºF capacitor
- A multimeter
:::


For the first exercise, we are going to place a 10-ŒºF capacitor in series with a 1-MŒ© resistor. In addition, a voltmeter needs to be placed across the capacitor in order to visualize both charge-up and discharge situations. In this lab, the multimeter is our voltmeter.

::: Figure
![setup](../imgs/circuit1.png)
:::

Before starting the experiment, we will make some basic theoretical calculations on this circuit to calibrate our expectations. In addition to predicting the time constant we will observer, we will use the tolerances of our components to find our error interval. 
:::::: Question
1. Calculate the theoretical value of the time constant for this RC circuit using the values of the resistor and capacitor. 
2. Using the uncertainty bounds of you resistor and capacitor calculate the error bound $\delta_\tau$  of this measurement. To calculate the total uncertainty of a product of two values with independent error bounds, use the following formula:


For a product
$$
\tau = RC
$$

The error bound, $\delta_\tau$,  of $\tau$ may be calculated as:
:::Equation producterror
$$
\frac{\delta_\tau}{\tau} \approx \Big|\frac{\delta_R}{R}\Big| + \Big|\frac{\delta_C}{C}\Big| 
$$
:::

You are not required to know how to derive this, but interested students can learn more about this formula in Taylor's excellent [Error Analysis Textbook](http://hep.ucsb.edu/courses/ph128_18f/Taylor.pdf)[fn]The formula is derived in section 2.9[/fn].

3. Write your final result as $(\tau \pm \delta_\tau)$ as usual.
::::::

:::::: Exercise ex1

We will be using our wires, elements, multimeter and breadboard to create the circuit. The instructions here look long only because there is no elegant way to explain circuit construction in words. Feel free to check with the above circuit diagram while following the instructions. After you have set everything up, the wiring should make sense.

Set-up:
AVOCADO !
1. Set up power supply and voltmeter.
2. Insert the resistor and capacitor into the breadboard. Note that rows (horizontal) within a given column are connected to each other, so the resistor should end in the same row in which the capacitor starts, to ensure they are connected together.
3. connect power supply to the circuit
4. connect the voltmeter across the capacitor.

This diagram shows how to connect elements in series and/or parallel. Note that all spots on the same row on breadboard are connected.

Once you have wired the circuit, you are ready to collect data. 

5. record the time it takes to charge the capacitor to ~0.63 of the maximum voltage. (Is a test run needed to find the max voltage?)
6. Use the recorded time to estimate $\tau$.


::: Question
### !  measure only the charging time?
What are the values calculated from charge and discharge curves? Are they close? Is it sufficient to measure ùõï from only one of the curves? Explain your reasoning.
:::

::: Question
1. What is the experimental value of $\tau$ measured? 

2. Calculate the discrepancy with the theoretical value.

3. Is the discrepancy within your error bounds? If not, propose some reasons for this. (Name possible sources of systematic error, *e.g.*, external factors like humidity or poor contact, that might lead to shorter discharge times, dying batteries, etc.)
