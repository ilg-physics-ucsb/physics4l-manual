# Light, Photons, and Planck&rsquo;s Constant 

By now you&rsquo;ve learned that light is, fundamentally, electromagnetic radiation: mathematically, it is a wave solution to Maxwell&rsquo;s equations that features oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. This classical picture of light is useful for many applications of optics, and provides an accurate description that is testable (as you have seen in the previous microwave lab). As you are nearing the completion of your introductory physics education, we now shift to looking beyond the classical behavior of physics and delving into the *quantum* realm.

## Photons 
The nature of light, as physicists learned in 1905, is not actually classical at the microscopic level. As it turns out, quantum mechanics dictates that energy is quantized, and hence that light has a *particle* nature. We call these particles that carry electromagnetic energy **photons**.

In the photoelectric effect, electrons can be ejected from a conductor if the incident light is above some threshold frequency corresponding to the *binding energy* of the electron in the valence orbital. If the frequency is less than this threshold, ejection will not occur regardless of the light&rsquo;s *intensity*.
:::
In 1905, Einstein published a seminal paper elucidating the *Photoelectric Effect* using the notion of photons, earning him his Nobel Prize. The Photoelectric Effect is the observation that electrons are ejected from some materials (typically metals) when light is shone on their surface. The rate at which the electrons are ejected from the metal, however, is not entirely proportional to the *intensity* (or the amount of light) as you might expect -- electrons seem only to respond to light that is *above* a certain cut-off frequency. From this empirical fact, coupled with progress in understanding *black body radiation*, it became clear to Einstein, that light must have a particle-like nature.

Einstein argued that the special, material-dependent cut-off frequency for ejecting electrons is precisely the frequency at which a photon&rsquo;s energy is *equal to or greater than* the binding energy between the electron and the nucleus of the atom. The implication was then that these light particles are directly converted into an electron&rsquo;s kinetic energy, allowing it to escape the electrostatic potential in an atom.

This discovery inevitably led to the development of quantum theory, and the notion of photons as the quantum mechanical carriers of electromagnetic energy.  Planck&rsquo;s constant gives the proportionality between frequency and energy for photons in the Planck-Einstein Relation:
:::Equation per
$$
E= h \nu
$$

## LEDs

The determination of Planck&rsquo;s constant was fairly difficult in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. It was first laboriously calculated by Planck in an elaborate *black body radiation* experiment, which requires deep knowledge of statistical physics and laboratory technique. Today, luckily, we can measure it quite easily, due to advances in solid-state circuitry and the invention of the light-emitting diode (LED).

:::
LEDs are specially manufactured semiconductor devices that basically accomplish the photoelectric effect in reverse. An LED contains layers of two different semiconductor materials that are &ldquo;doped.&rdquo; That is, one material has added to it a small amount of an element that has one valence electron fewer than it does, which results in vacancies, or &ldquo;holes&rdquo; (p-type).  The other type has added to it a small amount of an element that has one more valence electron than it does, which gives the material a slight excess of electrons (n-type). While the theory of semiconductors is far beyond the scope of this course, and is better treated in a solid-state physics class, we will briefly sketch the fundamental process that leads to photon emission below.



At small voltages, the boundary of the materials in the LED (the p-n junction) acts similarly to a capacitor. Electrons are not able to flow freely between the layers, and they accumulate on the surface. Unlike the situation with capacitors, however, once the voltage is increased beyond a threshold, electrons gain enough energy to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; across the material boundary. After the electron crosses this &ldquo;gap,&rdquo; it has extra energy, which is dissipated by the production of a photon of a specific frequency. The frequency of the photon is determined by the kinds of materials in the semiconductor, and the chemical treatments to which it is subjected.

We can associate the threshold voltage needed to cause electrons to &ldquo;jump the gap&rdquo; with the gap energy by:

:::Equation led
$$
E_{gap} = e V_{th}
$$
:::

Despite the complicated things that happen on a microscopic level, indeed the simple, naive, form of [Eq](#Eq-led) is actually true to a decent level of precision! We can then combine this relation with [Eq](#Eq-per) to obtain the functional equation

:::Equation ledper
$$
e V_{th} = h \nu
$$
:::

[Eq](#Eq-ledper) has two unknowns: $\nu$ and $V_{th}$. Luckily, we can measure the peak wavelength of the LED light for each provided component,  meaning that if then measure $V_{th}$, we can determine Planck&rsquo;s constant as:

:::Equation planck
$$
 h = \frac{e V_{th} \lambda}{c}
$$
:::


For the LEDs supplied in the RexQualis kit, the following Table shows the wavelength of the dominant peaks and its error:
:::Table
| Color|$\lambda$ (nm) | $\delta \lambda$ (nm)|
| ------| ------| ------ |
| Red  | 625| $\pm$ 5 |
|Yellow|592| $\pm$ 3 |
|Green |517| $\pm$ 3 |
|Blue |465| $\pm$ 5 |

If you do not have these LEDs, it is acceptable to use these values and make a note in your analysis of the results. 

# Using an LED to measure $h$




::: Materials
- Red, Blue, Green, Yellow LEDs
- Power Block
- Breadboard and Wires
- Potentiometer
- 220-$\Omega$ resistor (or 2 100-$\Omega$ resistors)
- Multimeter
:::

In this part of the lab, we will set up the basic experiment, which will allow us to measure $V_{th}$ for each of the LEDs. Since our power block does not allow us to modulate the voltage across the LED, we will use the 10-k trim pot as a **voltage divider**, allowing us to interpolate over a continuous range of voltages by using the analogue dial. The trim pot will be connected in series with a **current limiting** resistor to ensure that we do not blow out the LEDs, which can handle a maximum current of $30$ mA.

::::::Question
The potentiometer in your kit is a variable resistor. The resistance between leads 1 and 3 is always approximately $10$ k$\Omega$. As you turn the dial, the resistance between leads 1 and 2 ranges from approximately $0 \Omega$ to approximately $10$ k$\Omega$.

:::Figure vrr xl

In [Ex](#Ex-led), we will use the potentiometer as a voltage divider by connecting 1 to 3.3 V, 3 to ground, and 2 to a $220-\Omega$ resistor attached to the load.

 For the purpose of the following questions, treat the LED element as having infinite resistance, e.g. as an ideal capacitor, when analyzing the circuit diagram. This is appropriate for our experiment since we are working with the LEDs at voltages where they **do not emit light** or are just beginning to emit, and hence, pass no or negligible current.
 1. As a function of resistance between 1 and 2, $R_{1}$, the total resistance of the potentiometer $R_{tot}= 10$ k$\Omega$, and the current-limiting resistor $R_L= 220\ \Omega$, calculate the voltage across the LED. 

 2. What are the maximum and minimum voltages obtainable, and what $R_{1}$ corresponds to them?

 3. What value of $R_{1}$ would produce 1.5 V across the LED?

5. Run a jumper wire from your $220-\Omega$ resistor to one of the LEDs. 
6. Turn on your power block and rotate the potentiometer dial until you see the LED just barely light.

::::::Exercise led2
We will refine the measurement of $h$ by performing the measurement multiple times, and then calculating the value of $h$ from a linear relationship.

**Steps:**
1. Repeat the steps of [Ex](#Ex-led), but take **five** measurements for each LED color, resetting the potentiometer to 0 V after each trial.
2. Calculate the **average** turn-on voltage, $\bar V_{th}$ for 5 trials, as well as the **standard deviation**, $\delta V_{th}$. 
3. Record these values in a table like the one below.

:::Table
 
| Color|$\lambda$ | $\nu$ | $\bar V_{th}$| $\delta V_{th}$ |
| ------| ------| ------ |------| ------|

8. Repeat for all LED colors.

::::::Question
1. Present your table of data, with two additional columns showing the calculated value of $\bar h$ for each LED, and the standard deviation of $h$. 
    :::Table

    |@fa-pencil@     |        |         |        |        |       |        |

    :::
    The standard deviation of a product $A=XY$ is calculated as
    $$
    \frac{\delta A}{A} = \sqrt{ \Big(\frac{\delta X}{X}\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{\delta Y}{Y}\Big)^2}
    $$
2. Make a single scatter plot containing 
    - $\bar V_{th}$ vs. $\nu$
    - $(\bar V_{th} + \delta V_{th})$ vs. $\nu$
    - $(\bar V_{th} - \delta V_{th})$ vs. $\nu$

    The latter two plots are effectively showing the *error bars* on your first plot. You may use Google sheets to do this.
3. From the equation relating $V_{th}$ and $\nu$, what is the significance of the slope of this plot? Calculate the accepted theoretical value.
3. Find the value of the slope for the line of best fit for $\bar V_{th}$ vs. $\nu$. How does it compare to the accepted value you calculated?  
4. What value of $h$ does your slope indicate? 
5. Does your line of best fit intercept the origin? Explain what this means and provide some reasons for the observation.
6. Is the calculation of $h$ from your slope more accurate than the individual measurements? Why do you think this is?

:::Question

1. Which source of uncertainty, $\delta V_{th}$ or $\delta \lambda$, do you think influences the *precision* of your results more? Explain.
2. Which do you think influences your *accuracy* more? Explain.
